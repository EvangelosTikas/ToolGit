Notes, safety analysis & recommended future improvements

- *Git must be installed*: If not installe follow your system's recommended installation of git.
- - **Linux** (RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS) : `sudo dnf install git-all`
  - **MacOS** : `git --version` (promt to install it)
  - **Windows** : Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically.
  - Refer to: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git for more tips.

  
- Dry-run by default: destructive functions default to --dry behavior. Use --run to actually delete or alter your repo.

- Interactive confirmations: destructive operations prompt for confirmation; you can add --force to bypass (careful).

- Assumptions: functions assume origin remote; changeable by passing a different remote or editing the script to accept --remote.

- Extensibility: you can integrate these into a Makefile, or create gh subcommands (e.g., via git config --global alias.gh '!f() { source ~/bin/git-helpers.sh; gh_smart_pull --run; }; f').

- Testing: run shellcheck on the script and test in a disposable repo to confirm behavior matches your expectations.
